Lazy Fingertree in Go based on [Qiao's JavaScript version](https://github.com/qiao/fingertree.js/) of [Ralf Hinze's and Ross Paterson's Haskell version](http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/FingerTree.html)

The public API is generic but the implementation is currently not, because of some type resolution problems. In the future, the parameters will probably be pushed down into the implementation to make the code cleaner.
